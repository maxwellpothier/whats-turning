## Purpose
I'm a huge music fan. 
In college, I thought it was cool to dive deep into obscure bands and find one-off songs I thought were catchy. Soon enough I realized that these songs and bands I liked weren't sticking around for long. I'd have them in my rotation for a few weeks to a few months, but after a while they didn't mean much to me anymore. That's when I realized a lot of "mainstream" music is mainstream for a good reason. And that "mainstream" goes back to the 1930s, giving me an endless amount of music that had stood the test of time.
