## Purpose
I'm a huge music fan. 

In college, I thought it was cool to dive deep into obscure bands and find one-off songs I thought were catchy. Soon enough I realized that these songs and bands I liked weren't sticking around for long. I'd have them in my rotation for a few weeks to a few months, but after a while they didn't mean much to me anymore. That's when I realized a lot of "mainstream" music is mainstream for a good reason. And that "mainstream" goes back to the 1930s, giving me an endless amount of music that had stood the test of time.

I started broadening the communities I was a part of in the music scene and took a list of albums that seemed to impact a lot of different people. I listened to one album everyday and wrote down my thoughts. Many of these albums were not super easy to digest after the first couple tracks, but as I immersed myself deeper into the world the band was creating I felt more realness and connection and started to really enjoy the album. Other albums were just not good. As I listened to these "mainstream" albums in their entirety, I saw my understanding of good music start to grow and my taste in music broaden.

What's Turning is my attempt to bring others that same joy of broadening taste and seeing the beauty in a genre often looked down on.
